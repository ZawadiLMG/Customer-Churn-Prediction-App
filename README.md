# Customer-Churn-Prediction-App
A machine learning model (MLM) to predict customer churn using Streamlit (GUI). 

Streamlit is an open-source Python framework that enables the creation of dynamic and interactive data applications with minimal coding effort. In our customer churn prediction project, we utilized Streamlit to deploy our Logistic Regression and Random Forest models, making them accessible and user-friendly.

## Application consists of several key components:

- Home Page: Provides an overview of the application and its features, guiding users on how to navigate and utilize the app effectively.
- Data Dashboard: Visualizes key metrics and trends in the data, allowing users to gain insights into customer behavior and churn patterns. This page helps in understanding the data and the impact of different factors on customer retention.
- History Page: Tracks past predictions and model performance over time, offering a historical perspective on customer churn. This page is crucial for monitoring the accuracy and effectiveness of the models.
- Prediction Page: Allows users to input data and receive real-time predictions on customer churn. This interactive feature empowers users to make informed decisions based on the modelâ€™s output.

By deploying our models using Streamlit, we make sophisticated machine learning techniques accessible to a broader audience. This deployment enhances decision-making capabilities, helping businesses proactively address customer churn and improve retention strategies.
